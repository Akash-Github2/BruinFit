# CS35L Final Project: BruinFit

## Description

BruinFit is an online platform used to meet your fitness goals. Users can create their own accounts in order to set a goal weight, track calories consumed/burned, and add friends to compare progress. 

## Key Features

	1.	Users register for an account and create their own profiles. 
	2.	Add friends to view their profiles
	3.	Track your food/calories and log your exercises and calories burned 
	4.	Search through date to see your food consumption/activity for that specific day 
	5.	View a graph of your updated weight and ___________
	6.	Get updated amount of calories remaining for you to consume in the day to meet your goal 
	7.	Use navigation to go from page to page

## Important Files

App.js is used to connect the navigation to each of the pages by linking each one with routes

Firebase.js is used 

MenuItems.js gives each page a url, so that you can visit each page with a different url 

## Running the Application 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
